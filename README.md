A project that explores recent changes to Armenia using data and R programming language.

# What I've learned
1. Creating interactive plots using Plotly library
2. Deploying a R file using netlify
3. Finding and manipulating the data to the desired form with operations like pivot_wider, mutating, and filtering
4. Using a language that clearly describes the plots
